-- Sigma — roll raw_egov_amendments up onto raw_egov_contracts.
-- Run AFTER scripts/load-annexes.mjs (CSV) and scripts/load-ocds.mjs (OCDS amendments).
-- Re-runnable: resets the rollup, then matches amendments by (unp, contract_number).
-- current_value = the after-value of the LATEST amendment; annex_count = how many.
-- Contracts without amendments keep annex_count = 0 and current_value = NULL (the
-- convention downstream is COALESCE(current_value, signing_value)).
