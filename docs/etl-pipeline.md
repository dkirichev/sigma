# ETL pipeline — multi-source ingestion

> **Status: admin ЦАИС ЕОП export loaded AND normalized into the domain locally (May 2026).**
> The pipeline is now **two sources**: the **admin export** as the authoritative 2020–2026 base,
> and the **OCDS JSON feed** ([data.egov.bg](https://data.egov.bg)) as the go-forward 2026+ delta.
> The xlsx bootstrap ([data-ingestion.md](data-ingestion.md)) and the portal contracts CSV are
> **retired** (the CSV kept only as the coverage-comparison baseline). What remains: the **remote
> D1 push** and **OCDS scheduling**. Feeds the core explorer ([core-scope.md](core-scope.md)).

## Goal

A repeatable, idempotent ETL that loads the **authoritative admin ЦАИС ЕОП export** for 2020–2026
**once**, then **stays current from the OCDS feed** (the rich 2026+ JSON), and **closes the
[core-scope](core-scope.md#data-dependencies-this-scope-needs) propagation gaps** in the same
pass — the admin export carries the procedure-level fields per row, so `normalize` propagates
them directly (no separate enrichment join).

## Current state — implemented (May 2026)

The admin export is **loaded into staging AND normalized into the domain** in the local D1
(`sigma`). The earlier portal-CSV/xlsx ingest is superseded; see [Source history](#source-history)
for how we got here and what each retired loader still covers.

**Scripts + migrations (committed unless noted):**

- [`migrations/0003_egov_staging.sql`](../packages/db/migrations/0003_egov_staging.sql) — `raw_egov_contracts` (register fields + procedure-level slots + `needs_enrichment`).
- [`migrations/0004_egov_amendments.sql`](../packages/db/migrations/0004_egov_amendments.sql) — `raw_egov_amendments` + an `annex_count` column on contracts.
- [`migrations/0005_admin_rich.sql`](../packages/db/migrations/0005_admin_rich.sql) — rich admin columns on `raw_egov_contracts` (cpv_description, authority_type, awarded_to_group, lot_id, …) + the lot-grained `raw_egov_tenders` table.
- [`migrations/0006_domain_v2.sql`](../packages/db/migrations/0006_domain_v2.sql) — promotes the rich fields into the **domain** (authority `type`; tender `cpv_description`/`contract_kind`/`num_lots`; contract `contract_number`/`signing_value`/`current_value`/`annex_count`/`eu_funded`/`bids_received`/`contract_kind`/`awarded_to_group`).
- [`scripts/load-admin.mjs`](../scripts/load-admin.mjs) — the admin export loader (Contracts / Tenders / Annexes, 2020–2026).
- [`scripts/load-ocds.mjs`](../scripts/load-ocds.mjs) — OCDS JSON (2026+); emits contracts **and** amendments.
- [`scripts/derive-amendments.sql`](../scripts/derive-amendments.sql) — rolls `current_value` + `annex_count` onto contracts.
- [`scripts/normalize-egov.sql`](../scripts/normalize-egov.sql) — **normalize v2**: full rebuild of the domain from the admin staging.

**Loaded into local D1 — staging (`source LIKE 'admin:%'`):**

| Table | Rows | Contents |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `raw_egov_contracts` | 190,428 | admin contracts, 2020–2026 (rich per row, `needs_enrichment = 0`) |
| `raw_egov_tenders` | 323,290 | admin procedures, lot-grained (one header row + one row per lot, per УНП) |
| `raw_egov_amendments` | 24,744 | admin annexes (изменения), 2020–2026 |

**Normalized into the domain (`scripts/normalize-egov.sql`):**

| Domain table | Rows | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `authorities` | 4,868 | deduped on ЕИК; 4,867 carry a `type` (Вид на възложителя) |
| `tenders` | 139,718 | 128,070 from the tenders-export header rows + 11,648 **synthetic** for contract-only УНП |
| `lots` | 195,220 | one per lot row |
| `bidders` | 17,354 | keyed by ЕИК (valid) or **normalised name** (4,442 name-keyed); **3,716 consortia** |
| `contracts` | 190,427 | 190,428 admin rows − 1 nameless; **17,470 amended**; value_flag: 172 value_suspect / 55 annex_suspect / 758 review |

Canonical total **≈ 50.8 bn EUR** (`SUM(amount_eur)`, errors excluded; see [Data quality](#data-quality)).
Currency is kept **per row** on `amount` (BGN pre-2026, EUR from 2026, 49 foreign) — see [Currency](#currency-not-one-unit).

**Where it's stored.** The local Cloudflare D1 database `sigma`, on disk under
`apps/api/.wrangler/state/v3/d1/` (miniflare SQLite, via `wrangler … --local`). The admin export
(`data/Open_data_resources.zip`) and the generated load SQL (`data/*-load.sql`) sit in `data/`,
which is **gitignored**. **Nothing is on the remote D1 yet** — `database_id` is still the `0000…`
placeholder; a remote push needs Cloudflare auth (`pnpm bootstrap:apply`, then the loaders +
normalize with `--remote`).

**Known deliberate gap — the РОП register.** The admin export is **ЦАИС-ЕОП only**, so it omits
the legacy РОП (Регистър на обществените поръчки) contracts — ~28k thin pre-ЦАИС rows, mostly
2020 (≈20k), tailing off through 2023. Coverage of the ЦАИС era is otherwise complete (99.98 % vs
the open data, values matching 99.98 %). We chose **admin-only** and do **not** backfill РОП; if
full pre-2020 coverage is ever needed, the retired portal CSV loader can add those rows as thin
(procedure-less) contracts.

## Currency (not one unit)

Unlike the xlsx (all EUR), the admin export spans the **BGN→EUR switch**: 2020–2025 contracts are
in **BGN**, 2026 in **EUR**, plus 49 foreign-currency contracts (USD/CHF/GBP/TRY/SEK/CZK). `normalize`
keeps each row's **native currency** on `amount`/`currency` (the faithful as-recorded value) and also
derives the canonical **`contracts.amount_eur`** for safe aggregation: BGN→EUR at the fixed peg
(÷ 1.95583), EUR as-is, and **foreign currencies at the ECB reference rate on the contract's signing
date** (`fx_rates`, loaded by [`scripts/load-fx.mjs`](../scripts/load-fx.mjs) via frankfurter.app;
`fx_converted = 1` marks those rows and `fx_rate` stores the applied rate on the row, so `amount` ×
`fx_rate` = `amount_eur` is auditable without a join). So `SUM(amount_eur)` is a clean single-currency total.
Display in лева is `amount_eur × 1.95583` (IA editorial principle #1). This corrects the earlier
"storage unit is EUR" framing being absent in [core-scope.md](core-scope.md).

## Data quality

The admin register carries a small number of **source** data-entry errors. They were investigated
(May 2026) and are handled in `normalize-egov.sql` **non-destructively** — staging stays raw; the
verdict (`value_flag`) and the clean amount (`amount_eur`) are derived columns. See
[0007_data_quality.sql](../packages/db/migrations/0007_data_quality.sql).

- **Value errors (~213 contracts, 0.12 % of rows but ~12 % of the naive total).** A signed or amended
  value ≥100× the procurement's estimate. Raw-cell inspection shows a **dropped decimal comma at
  source** (signing `6938481985,00` vs estimate `69384819,85`), and a **cross-check against the
  open-data portal found the identical wrong values** (same ЦАИС source — 108/108 matched, none
  corrected) — so they are upstream errors, not a load artifact, and are **not recoverable**. Hence
  `value_flag`, never a fabricated correction:
  - `value_suspect` — the signed value itself is ≥100× the estimate → **excluded** from `amount_eur`.
  - `annex_suspect` — an amendment pushed `current_value` ≥100× signing (or negative); the signing
    value is sane (matches the estimate) → **fall back to signing**, so the contract still counts
    (e.g. the ЕТ whose annex read 4.6 bn falls back to its 113 500 signing).
  - `review` — 10–100× (gray zone: some real frameworks, some errors) → kept, flagged.
- **Recipient identity.** Bidders are keyed by ЕИК when valid (9/13 digits), else by **normalised
  name** — stopping the collapse where ~595 distinct withheld-ЕИК (`не се публикува`) contractors
  merged onto one node, and recovering 839 contracts whose contractor had a name but no ЕИК.
- **Foreign currency.** The 49 USD/CHF/GBP/TRY/SEK/CZK contracts are converted to `amount_eur` at the
  ECB reference rate on the **signing date** (`fx_converted = 1`); the raw `amount`/`currency` is kept.
- **Minor** (negligible, surfaced not altered): 33 out-of-range dates, 187 zero-value, the 1 negative
  (resolved by the annex fallback), ~269 duplicate `(УНП, contract_number)` keys (mostly real multi-lot).

Net canonical headline `SUM(amount_eur)` (every currency in EUR, errors excluded) ≈ **50.8 bn EUR**.

## Sources

Two sources feed the domain today, plus retired loaders kept for history.

| Source | What it carries | Period | Format | Role |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Admin ЦАИС ЕОП export** (`data/Open_data_resources.zip`) | Contracts / Tenders / Annexes — rich per row: procedure type, CPV (+ label), estimated/signing/current value, lots, authority type, EU funding, bid count, consortium flag | 2020–2026 | CSV (nested zips) | **authoritative base**; loaded once by `load-admin.mjs` |
| **OCDS release packages** (data.egov.bg, org `502`) | full nested model: parties / tender / lots / awards / contracts / bids / amendments | 2026+ | JSON | **the ongoing/live feed**; `load-ocds.mjs` |

The admin export already covers through its snapshot date (2026-05-22), so there is **no overlap to
reconcile today**; OCDS is the mechanism to stay current after it. When OCDS later returns a record
the admin snapshot already has, **admin wins** — dedupe on `(УНП, contract_number)` at load time
(the admin rows are richer). A contract whose УНП has no tenders-export row gets a **synthetic
tender** at normalize time, so every contract has a parent regardless of source.

## Source history

The pipeline reached the admin export through two now-retired ingests:

- **xlsx bootstrap** ([data-ingestion.md](data-ingestion.md)) — two sector workbooks (~129k rows, all
  EUR) into `raw_aop_contracts`. Thin and EUR-only; **retired** (`raw_aop_contracts` is empty, the
  domain is rebuilt from the admin export).
- **Portal contracts/annexes CSV** (`load-egov.mjs` / `load-annexes.mjs`, data.egov.bg org `502`) —
  the public "Договори и изменения" register, 2016–2023, **broader** (all sectors, incl. РОП) but
  **thinner** per row (no procedure type / CPV / estimated value; `needs_enrichment = 1`). Used to
  **verify admin coverage** (it is how we measured the 99.98 % match and found the РОП gap), kept as
  that baseline but **not part of the live pipeline**. Its **dual-schema** handling is a finding worth
  keeping: АОП ships two header layouts — ЦАИС ЕОП („Уникален номер на поръчката", „Номер на договор",
  …) and the older **РОП** (`УНП`, `ДОГОВОР НОМЕР`, uppercased, leading blank column) — so any loader
  that touches the portal CSV must match headers **by name, case-insensitively, with aliases** (without
  it, РОП/2016–2019 files load only their two ЕИК columns).

## Architecture — one domain, many feeds

As built: per-source **loaders** write **dedicated staging tables** (rather than one canonical
`stg_*` table — the simpler choice that won), and a single SQL **rebuild** derives the domain.

```
admin export (zip: Contracts/Tenders/Annexes) ─load-admin.mjs─┐
OCDS JSON (2026+) ──────────────────────────────load-ocds.mjs─┤
                                                               ▼
   staging:  raw_egov_contracts · raw_egov_tenders · raw_egov_amendments
                    (source discriminator; scoped full-reload per feed)
                                                               │ derive-amendments.sql  (current_value + annex_count)
                                                               │ normalize-egov.sql      (full domain rebuild)
                                                               ▼
              authorities · tenders · lots · bidders · contracts
```

**Staging.** Three tables keyed by a `source` discriminator (`admin:contracts:YEAR`,
`admin:tenders:YEAR`, `admin:annexes:YEAR`, `ocds:YEAR:…`). Each feed is reloaded with a **scoped
full-reload** (`DELETE … WHERE source LIKE '<prefix>:%'`) so feeds coexist and a re-run is
idempotent. The admin export carries the procedure-level fields per row, so `needs_enrichment = 0`
and there is **no separate enrichment join** (the obsolete plan was a `УНП` merge of a thin CSV
with a later admin export — collapsed now that the admin export *is* the base).

**Loaders.** `load-admin.mjs` unzips the nested admin export and parses the EU-formatted CSVs
(comma decimals, dot dates, Да/Не booleans), batched to ≤90 KB UTF-8 (Cyrillic is 2 bytes/char)
and run as one atomic D1 batch. `load-ocds.mjs` walks OCDS release packages → contract +
amendment rows. `derive-amendments.sql` then rolls each contract's latest after-value into
`current_value` and counts annexes into `annex_count`.

**normalize v2** ([`normalize-egov.sql`](../scripts/normalize-egov.sql)). Full rebuild of the
domain from staging (deterministic, re-runnable, atomic): authorities deduped on ЕИК (+ `type`);
tenders from the tenders-export header rows plus a synthetic tender per contract-only УНП; lots
from the lot rows; bidders deduped on contractor ЕИК with a name-based consortium flag; contracts
1:1 with admin rows, `amount` = current value, with the core-scope fields propagated. Amendment
detail stays in `raw_egov_amendments` (no separate domain table) — the rollup onto contracts is
all the core needs; the full annex history feeds the parked signals.

**Still to build:** a provenance/freshness record (fetched_at, row_count, status per source) to
surface the **data-freshness date the IA requires** and to drive incremental OCDS loads.

## Runtime — backfill local, deltas (optionally) on a Worker

Split by **job**, not by environment; the transform logic is shared, so the split does **not**
double the work. The only non-shared code is the thin I/O shell.

| Job | Size | Runtime |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Backfill (the admin export, 2020–2026) | heavy, **one-time**, attended | **Node CLI** (`load-admin.mjs` + `normalize-egov.sql`), local or CI — never a Worker |
| Ongoing feed (**OCDS releases, 2026+**) | small, frequent, unattended | `load-ocds.mjs`, run by the CLI on CI cron *or* a thin **`apps/etl` Worker Cron Trigger** |

The Worker only ever handles small **OCDS** deltas, so it stays under memory/CPU limits — it never
parses the admin zip and never does bulk. Porting the *whole* pipeline into a Worker is the
anti-pattern (it duplicates logic and blows the limits); assigning each job to the right runtime is
what keeps it cheap. Until the Worker is wired, the CLI on a schedule (or manual) does the OCDS job.

- **Secrets:** **none for reads** — the OCDS feed is anonymous and the admin export is a local file.
  National-registry **write/private** credentials (НАП / Търговски регистър / АОП) remain production
  secrets, never committed (per [AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md)); they belong to the parked owner layer.

## Dedup & identity

- **Contract identity:** one domain contract per admin staging row (`c:<staging id>`); a procurement
  is keyed by **УНП** (`tenders.source_id`), the link to OCDS `ocid`.
- **admin ↔ OCDS:** the admin export is the system of record through its snapshot date; OCDS
  **continues** the timeline after it. Where they overlap, **admin wins** — dedupe on
  `(УНП, contract_number)` at OCDS load time (admin rows are richer). No silent collisions.
- **Grain:** the tenders export is one **header row** per УНП (→ one `tenders` row) plus one row per
  **lot** (→ `lots`); each contract award line is its own contract. УНП seen only in contracts gets a
  synthetic tender so every contract has a parent.

## Phasing

| Phase | Work | Delivers |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **0 — Spike** (read-only) | pull one real contracts + amendments + procurements resource; confirm API/auth, encoding, and column parity | locked staging columns; go/no-go; findings note |
| **1 — Canonical staging + propagation** | migration to the superset schema; refactor the xlsx loader into the first adapter; normalize v2 propagates core-scope fields | multi-source-ready schema **and** the core-scope data-dependencies, in one migration |
| **2 — egov CSV backfill** (one-time) | fetcher + provenance; egov-contracts / -amendments / -procurements adapters; bulk load of 2007–2025 | the full historical corpus from the portal |
| **3 — OCDS adapter (2026+)** | release-package parsing → staging; idempotent **incremental** load keyed by `ocid` | the **ongoing/refreshable** feed; multi-supplier awards feed the (parked) consortium members for free |
| **4 — Scheduling** (optional) | the **OCDS** delta on CI cron, or a thin `apps/etl` Worker Cron Trigger | unattended refresh; freshness surfaced in the UI |

**Status against this plan (the phases above are the original portal design; superseded by the
admin export):** the spike, the egov CSV backfill and the OCDS adapter all ran; the **column-parity
gap** they exposed (no procedure type / CPV / estimated in the portal CSV) is what motivated sourcing
the **admin export**, which carries those fields per row — so **normalize v2 is done** against the
admin staging (see [Current state](#current-state--implemented-may-2026)) and the УНП enrichment
merge is **obsolete**. **Remaining:** the **remote D1 push** and **Phase 4 scheduling** (the OCDS
delta on cron / a thin `apps/etl` Worker).

## Findings (resolved during the build)

- **API:** every method is `POST https://data.egov.bg/api/<method>`; **no api_key for reads**.
  АОП is org `502`. Flow: `listDatasets` (criteria `org_ids:[502]`) → `listResources` (criteria
  `dataset_uri`) → `getResourceData` (returns the whole resource as JSON).
- **Encoding/format:** `getResourceData` returns UTF-8 JSON — for CSV resources `data` is an array
  with the **header in row 0**; cells arrive **quote-wrapped**, dates are **DD/MM/YYYY**, booleans
  **True/False**. Currency is **BGN** in the CSVs, **EUR** in OCDS 2026.
- **Column parity (the decisive finding):** the portal contracts CSV has **no** procedure_type /
  CPV / estimated_value and there is **no 2016+ procurements CSV** to recover them — which is exactly
  why we sourced the **admin export**, where every contract row carries them. That collapsed the
  planned УНП enrichment merge into a single authoritative load.
- **Dual schema:** ЦАИС ЕОП vs older РОП header layouts (see [Source history](#source-history)) —
  handled in the portal loaders by case-insensitive alias mapping; not a concern for the admin export.
- **Portal handoff gap:** the annual portal "Договори и изменения" CSVs end at **2023** and OCDS
  starts **2026**, leaving **2024–2025** uncovered on the portal — **the admin export fills it** (it
  is continuous 2020–2026), which is another reason it superseded the portal CSV.
